Van Dyne and Raymer for the [Tennessee\nValley Authority](Tennessee_Valley_Authority \"wikilink\"), the average US\nfarm consumes fuel at the rate of 82 litres per hectare\n(8.75 US gal/acre) of land to produce one crop. However, average crops\nof rapeseed produce oil at an average rate of 1,029 L/ha\n(110 US gal/acre), and high-yield rapeseed fields produce about\n1,356 L/ha (145 US gal/acre). The ratio of input to output in these\ncases is roughly 1:12.5 and 1:16.5. Photosynthesis is known to have an\n[efficiency rate](Photosynthetic_efficiency \"wikilink\") of about 3–6% of\ntotal solar radiation[122] and if the entire mass of a crop is utilized\nfor energy production, the overall efficiency of this chain is currently\nabout 1%[123] While this may compare unfavorably to [solar\ncells](solar_cells \"wikilink\") combined with an electric drive train,\nbiodiesel is less costly to deploy (solar cells cost approximately\nUS$250 per square meter) and transport (electric vehicles require\nbatteries which currently have a much lower [energy\ndensity](energy_density \"wikilink\") than liquid fuels). A 2005 study\nfound that biodiesel production using soybeans required 27% more fossil\nenergy than the biodiesel produced and 118% more energy using\nsunflowers.[124]\n\nHowever, these statistics by themselves are not enough to show whether\nsuch a change makes economic sense. Additional factors must be taken\ninto account, such as: the fuel equivalent of the energy required for\nprocessing, the yield of fuel from raw oil, the return on cultivating\nfood, the effect biodiesel will have on [food\nprices](food_prices \"wikilink\") and the relative cost of biodiesel\nversus petrodiesel, water pollution from farm run-off, soil depletion,\nand the externalized costs of political and military interference in\noil-producing countries intended to control the price of petrodiesel.\n\nThe debate over the [energy\nbalance](Energy_returned_on_energy_invested \"wikilink\") of biodiesel is\nongoing. Transitioning fully to biofuels could require immense tracts of\nland if traditional food crops are used (although [non food\ncrops](non_food_crop \"wikilink\") can be utilized). The problem would be\nespecially severe for nations with large economies, since energy\nconsumption scales with economic output.[125]\n\nIf using only traditional food plants, most such nations do not have\nsufficient arable land to produce biofuel for the nation's vehicles.\nNations with smaller economies (hence less energy consumption) and more\narable land may be in better situations, although many regions cannot\nafford to divert land away from food production.\n\nFor [third world](third_world \"wikilink\") countries, biodiesel sources\nthat use marginal land could make more sense; e.g., [pongam\noiltree](Millettia_pinnata \"wikilink\") nuts grown along roads or\n[jatropha](jatropha \"wikilink\") grown along rail lines.[126]\n\nIn tropical regions, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, plants that produce\npalm oil are being planted at a rapid pace to supply growing biodiesel\ndemand in Europe and other markets. Scientists have shown that the\nremoval of rainforest for palm plantations is not ecologically sound\nsince the expansion of oil palm plantations poses a threat to natural\nrainforest and biodiversity.[127]\n\nIt has been estimated in Germany that palm oil biodiesel has less than\none third of the production costs of rapeseed biodiesel.[128] The direct\nsource of the energy content of biodiesel is solar energy captured by\nplants during [photosynthesis](photosynthesis \"wikilink\"). Regarding the\npositive energy balance of biodiesel:\n\n  \nWhen straw was left in the field, biodiesel production was strongly\nenergy positive, yielding 1 GJ biodiesel for every 0.561 GJ of energy\ninput (a yield/cost ratio of 1.78).\n\nWhen straw was burned as fuel and oilseed rapemeal was used as a\nfertilizer, the yield/cost ratio for biodiesel production was even\nbetter (3.71). In other words, for every unit of energy input to produce\nbiodiesel, the output was 3.71 units (the difference of 2.71 units would\nbe from solar energy).\n\n## Economic impact\n\nMultiple economic studies have been performed regarding the economic\nimpact of biodiesel production. One study, commissioned by the National\nBiodiesel Board, reported the production of biodiesel supported more\nthan 64,000 jobs.[129] The growth in biodiesel also helps significantly\nincrease GDP. In 2011, biodiesel created more than $3 billion in GDP.\nJudging by the continued growth in the Renewable Fuel Standard and the\nextension of the biodiesel tax incentive, the number of jobs can\nincrease to 50,725, $2.7 billion in income, and reaching $5 billion in\nGDP by 2012 and 2013.[130]\n\n## Energy security\n\nOne of the main drivers for adoption of biodiesel is [energy\nsecurity](energy_security \"wikilink\"). This means that a nation's\ndependence on oil is reduced, and substituted with use of locally\navailable sources, such as coal, gas, or renewable sources. Thus a\ncountry can benefit from adoption of biofuels, without a reduction in\ngreenhouse gas emissions. While the total energy balance is debated, it\nis clear that the dependence on oil is reduced. One example is the\nenergy used to manufacture fertilizers, which could come from a variety\nof sources other than petroleum. The US National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory (NREL) states that energy security is the number one driving\nforce behind the US biofuels programme,[131] and a White House \"Energy\nSecurity for the 21st Century\" paper makes it clear that energy security\nis a major reason for promoting biodiesel.[132] The former EU commission\npresident, Jose Manuel Barroso, speaking at a recent EU biofuels\nconference, stressed that properly managed biofuels have the potential\nto reinforce the EU's security of supply through diversification of\nenergy sources.[133]\n\n## Global biofuel policies\n\nMany countries around the world are involved in the growing use and\nproduction of biofuels, such as biodiesel, as an alternative energy\nsource to fossil fuels and oil. To foster the biofuel industry,\ngovernments have implemented legislations and laws as incentives to\nreduce oil dependency and to increase the use of renewable\nenergies.[134] Many countries have their own independent policies\nregarding the taxation and rebate of biodiesel use, import, and\nproduction.\n\n### Canada\n\nIt was required by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act Bill C-33\nthat by the year 2010, gasoline contained 5% renewable content and that\nby 2013, diesel and heating oil contained 2% renewable content.[135] The\nEcoENERGY for Biofuels Program subsidized the production of biodiesel,\namong other biofuels, via an incentive rate of CAN$0.20 per liter from\n2008 to 2010. A decrease of $0.04 will be applied every year following,\nuntil the incentive rate reaches $0.06 in 2016. Individual provinces\nalso have specific legislative measures in regards to biofuel use and\nproduction.[136]\n\n### United States\n\nThe [Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax\nCredit](United_States_biofuel_policies#Internal_Revenue_Service_(IRS) \"wikilink\")\n(VEETC) was the main source of financial support for biofuels, but was\nscheduled to expire in 2010. Through this act, biodiesel production\nguaranteed a tax credit of US$1 per gallon produced from virgin oils,\nand $0.50 per gallon made from recycled oils.[137] Currently soybean oil\nis being used to produce soybean biodiesel for many commercial purposes\nsuch as blending fuel for transportation sectors.[138]\n\n### European Union\n\nThe European Union is the greatest producer of biodiesel, with France\nand Germany being the top producers. To increase the use of biodiesel,\nthere are policies requiring the blending of biodiesel into fuels,\nincluding penalties if those rates are not reached. In France, the goal\nwas to reach 10% integration but plans for that stopped in 2010.[139] As\nan incentive for the European Union countries to continue the production\nof the biofuel, there are tax rebates for specific quotas of biofuel\nproduced. In Germany, the minimum percentage of biodiesel in transport\ndiesel is set at 7% so called \"B7\".\n\n## Environmental effects\n\nThe surge of interest in biodiesels has highlighted a number of\n[environmental effects](List_of_environmental_issues \"wikilink\")\nassociated with its use. These potentially include reductions in\n[greenhouse gas](greenhouse_gas \"wikilink\") emissions,[140]\n[deforestation](deforestation \"wikilink\"), pollution and the rate of\n[biodegradation](biodegradation \"wikilink\").\n\nAccording to the EPA's [Renewable Fuel Standards Program Regulatory\nImpact\nAnalysis](https://web.archive.org/web/20110202202402/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/420r10006.pdf),\nreleased in February 2010, biodiesel from soy oil results, on average,\nin a 57% reduction in greenhouse gases compared to petroleum diesel, and\nbiodiesel produced from waste grease results in an 86% reduction. See\nchapter 2.6 of [the EPA\nreport](https://web.archive.org/web/20110202202402/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/renewablefuels/420r10006.pdf)\nfor more detailed information.\n\nHowever, environmental organizations, for example, [Rainforest\nRescue](Rettet_den_Regenwald \"wikilink\")[141] and\n[Greenpeace](Greenpeace \"wikilink\"),[142] criticize the cultivation of\nplants used for biodiesel production, e.g., oil palms, soybeans and\nsugar cane. The deforestation of rainforests exacerbates climate change\nand sensitive ecosystems are destroyed to clear land for oil palm,\nsoybean and sugar cane plantations. Moreover, that biofuels contribute\nto world hunger, seeing as arable land is no longer used for growing\nfoods. The [Environmental Protection\nAgency](Environmental_Protection_Agency \"wikilink\") (EPA) published data\nin January 2012, showing that biofuels made from palm oil will not count\ntowards the nation's renewable fuels mandate as they are not\nclimate-friendly.[143] Environmentalists welcome the conclusion because\nthe growth of oil palm plantations has driven tropical deforestation,\nfor example, in Indonesia and Malaysia.[144][145]\n\n## Food, land and water vs. fuel\n\nIn some poor countries the rising price of vegetable oil is causing\nproblems.[146][147] Some propose that fuel only be made from non-edible\nvegetable oils such as [camelina](camelina \"wikilink\"),\n[jatropha](jatropha \"wikilink\") or [seashore\nmallow](seashore_mallow \"wikilink\")[148] which can thrive on marginal\nagricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow, or would\nproduce only low yields.\n\nOthers argue that the problem is more fundamental. Farmers may switch\nfrom producing food crops to producing biofuel crops to make more money,\neven if the new crops are not edible.[149][150] The [law of supply and\ndemand](law_of_supply_and_demand \"wikilink\") predicts that if fewer\nfarmers are producing food the price of food will rise. It may take some\ntime, as farmers can take some time to change which things they are\ngrowing, but increasing demand for [first generation\nbiofuels](first_generation_biofuel \"wikilink\") is likely to result in\nprice increases for many kinds of food. Some have pointed out that there\nare poor farmers and poor countries who are making more money because of\nthe higher price of vegetable oil.[151]\n\nBiodiesel from sea algae would not necessarily displace terrestrial land\ncurrently used for food production and new\n[algaculture](algaculture \"wikilink\") jobs could be created.\n\nBy comparison it should be mentioned that the production of\n[biogas](biogas \"wikilink\") utilizes agricultural waste to generate a\n[biofuel](biofuel \"wikilink\") known as biogas, and also produces\n[compost](compost \"wikilink\"), thereby enhancing agriculture,\nsustainability and food production.\n\n## Current research\n\nThere is ongoing research into finding more suitable crops and improving\noil yield. Other sources are possible including human\n[fecal](fecal \"wikilink\") matter, with [Ghana](Ghana \"wikilink\")\nbuilding its first \"fecal sludge-fed biodiesel plant.\"[152] Using the\ncurrent yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to\nproduce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. It would\nrequire twice the land area of the US to be devoted to soybean\nproduction, or two-thirds to be devoted to rapeseed production, to meet\ncurrent US heating and transportation needs.\n\nSpecially bred mustard varieties can produce reasonably high oil yields\nand are very useful in [crop rotation](crop_rotation \"wikilink\") with\ncereals, and have the added benefit that the meal leftover after the oil\nhas been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable\npesticide.[153]\n\nThe [NFESC](NFESC \"wikilink\"), with [Santa\nBarbara](Santa_Barbara,_California \"wikilink\")-based Biodiesel\nIndustries is working to develop biodiesel technologies for the US navy\nand military, one of the largest diesel fuel users in the world.[154]\n\nA group of Spanish developers working for a company called\n[Ecofasa](http://agnux.wordpress.com/tag/ecofasa/) announced a new\nbiofuel made from trash. The fuel is created from general urban waste\nwhich is treated by bacteria to produce fatty acids, which can be used\nto make biodiesel.[155]\n\nAnother approach that does not require the use of chemical for the\nproduction involves the use of genetically modified microbes.[156][157]\n\n### Algal biodiesel\n\nFrom 1978 to 1996, the [U.S.\nNREL](National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory \"wikilink\") experimented with\nusing algae as a biodiesel source in the \"[Aquatic Species\nProgram](Aquatic_Species_Program \"wikilink\")\".[158] A self-published\narticle by Michael Briggs, at the\n[UNH](University_of_New_Hampshire \"wikilink\") Biodiesel Group, offers\nestimates for the realistic replacement of all\n[vehicular](motor_vehicle \"wikilink\") fuel with biodiesel by utilizing\nalgae that have a natural oil content greater than 50%, which Briggs\nsuggests can be grown on algae ponds at [wastewater\ntreatment](wastewater_treatment \"wikilink\") plants.[159] This oil-rich\nalgae can then be extracted from the system and processed into\nbiodiesel, with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create\nethanol.\n\nThe production of algae to harvest oil for biodiesel has not yet been\nundertaken on a commercial scale, but [feasibility\nstudies](feasibility_study \"wikilink\") have been conducted to arrive at\nthe above yield estimate. In addition to its projected high yield,\nalgaculture — unlike [crop-based](agriculture \"wikilink\") biofuels —\ndoes not entail a decrease in [food\nproduction](food_production \"wikilink\"), since it requires neither\n[farmland](farmland_(farming) \"wikilink\") nor [fresh\nwater](fresh_water \"wikilink\"). Many companies are pursuing algae\nbio-reactors for various purposes, including scaling up biodiesel\nproduction to commercial levels.[160]<ref>\n\n</ref>\n\nProf. [Rodrigo E. Teixeira](Rodrigo_E._Teixeira \"wikilink\") from the\n[University of Alabama in\nHuntsville](University_of_Alabama_in_Huntsville \"wikilink\") demonstrated\nthe extraction of biodiesel lipids from wet algae using a simple and\neconomical reaction in [ionic liquids](ionic_liquids \"wikilink\").[161]\n\n### Pongamia\n\n*Millettia pinnata*, also known as the Pongam Oiltree or Pongamia, is a\nleguminous, oilseed-bearing tree that has been identified as a candidate\nfor non-edible vegetable oil production.\n\nPongamia plantations for biodiesel production have a two-fold\nenvironmental benefit. The trees both store carbon and produce fuel oil.\nPongamia grows on marginal land not fit for food crops and does not\nrequire nitrate fertilizers. The oil producing tree has the highest\nyield of oil producing plant (approximately 40% by weight of the seed is\noil) while growing in malnourished soils with high levels of salt. It is\nbecoming a main focus in a number of biodiesel research\norganizations.[162] The main advantages of Pongamia are a higher\nrecovery and quality of oil than other crops and no direct competition\nwith food crops. However, growth on marginal land can lead to lower oil\nyields which could cause competition with food crops for better soil.\n\n### Jatropha\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"Jatropha_Biodiesel_-_DRDO_-_Pride_of_India_-_Exhibition_-_100th_Indian_Science_Congress_-_Kolkata_2013-01-03_2579.JPG\" title=\"Jatropha Biodiesel from DRDO, India.\" width=\"150\" alt=\"Jatropha Biodiesel from DRDO, India.\" /><figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Jatropha Biodiesel from <a href=\"Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation\" title=\"wikilink\">DRDO</a>, India.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSeveral groups in various sectors are conducting research on Jatropha\ncurcas, a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by\nmany to be a viable source of biodiesel feedstock oil.[163] Much of this\nresearch focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of Jatropha\nthrough advancements in genetics, soil science, and horticultural\npractices.\n\n[SG Biofuels](SG_Biofuels \"wikilink\"), a San Diego-based Jatropha\ndeveloper, has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce\nelite hybrid seeds of Jatropha that show significant yield improvements\nover first generation varieties.[164] [SG\nBiofuels](SG_Biofuels \"wikilink\") also claims that additional benefits\nhave arisen from such strains, including improved flowering\nsynchronicity, higher resistance to pests and disease, and increased\ncold weather tolerance.[165]\n\nPlant Research International, a department of the [Wageningen University\nand Research\nCentre](Wageningen_University_and_Research_Centre \"wikilink\") in the\nNetherlands, maintains an ongoing Jatropha Evaluation Project (JEP) that\nexamines the feasibility of large scale Jatropha cultivation through\nfield and laboratory experiments.[166]\n\nThe [Center for Sustainable Energy\nFarming](Center_for_Sustainable_Energy_Farming \"wikilink\") (CfSEF) is a\nLos Angeles-based non-profit research organization dedicated to Jatropha\nresearch in the areas of plant science, agronomy, and horticulture.\nSuccessful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase\nJatropha farm production yields by 200–300% in the next ten years.[167]\n\n### FOG from sewage\n\nSo-called [fats, oils and grease](fats,_oils_and_grease \"wikilink\")\n(FOG), recovered from [sewage](sewage \"wikilink\") can also be turned\ninto biodiesel.[168]\n\n### Fungi\n\nA group at the [Russian Academy of\nSciences](Russian_Academy_of_Sciences \"wikilink\") in Moscow published a\npaper in September 2008, stating that they had isolated large amounts of\nlipids from single-celled fungi and turned it into biodiesel in an\neconomically efficient manner. More research on this fungal species;\n*[Cunninghamella](Cunninghamella \"wikilink\")*\n*[japonica](http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&MycoBankNr_=252812)*,\nand others, is likely to appear in the near future.[169]\n\nThe recent discovery of a variant of the fungus *[Gliocladium\nroseum](Gliocladium_roseum \"wikilink\")* points toward the production of\nso-called [myco-diesel](myco-diesel \"wikilink\") from cellulose. This\norganism was recently discovered in the rainforests of northern\n[Patagonia](Patagonia \"wikilink\") and has the unique capability of\nconverting cellulose into medium length hydrocarbons typically found in\ndiesel fuel.[170]\n\n### Biodiesel from used coffee grounds\n\nResearchers at the [University of Nevada,\nReno](University_of_Nevada,_Reno \"wikilink\"), have successfully produced\nbiodiesel from oil derived from [used coffee\ngrounds](used_coffee_grounds \"wikilink\"). Their analysis of the used\ngrounds showed a 10% to 15% oil content (by weight). Once the oil was\nextracted, it underwent conventional processing into biodiesel. It is\nestimated that finished biodiesel could be produced for about one US\ndollar per gallon. Further, it was reported that \"the technique is not\ndifficult\" and that \"there is so much coffee around that several hundred\nmillion gallons of biodiesel could potentially be made annually.\"\nHowever, even if all the coffee grounds in the world were used to make\nfuel, the amount produced would be less than 1 percent of the diesel\nused in the United States annually. \"It won’t solve the world’s energy\nproblem,\" Dr. Misra said of his work.[171]\n\n### Exotic sources\n\nRecently, [alligator](alligator \"wikilink\") fat was identified as a\nsource to produce biodiesel. Every year, about 15 million pounds of\n[alligator](alligator \"wikilink\") fat are disposed of in landfills as a\nwaste byproduct of the alligator meat and skin industry. Studies have\nshown that biodiesel produced from alligator fat is similar in\ncomposition to biodiesel created from soybeans, and is cheaper to refine\nsince it is primarily a waste product.[172]\n\n### Biodiesel to hydrogen-cell power\n\nA microreactor has been developed to convert biodiesel into hydrogen\nsteam to power fuel cells.[173]\n\n**Steam reforming**, also known as **fossil fuel reforming** is a\nprocess which produces hydrogen gas from hydrocarbon fuels, most notably\nbiodiesel due to its efficiency. A \\*\\*microreactor\\*\\*, or reformer, is\nthe processing device in which water vapour reacts with the liquid fuel\nunder high temperature and pressure. Under temperatures ranging from 700\n– 1100 °C, a nickel-based catalyst enables the production of carbon\nmonoxide and hydrogen:[174]\n\n*Hydrocarbon + H2O ⇌ CO + 3 H2 (Highly endothermic)*\n\nFurthermore, a higher yield of hydrogen gas can be harnessed by further\noxidizing carbon monoxide to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide:\n\n*CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (Mildly exothermic)*\n\n**Hydrogen fuel cells background information**\n\nFuel cells operate similar to a battery in that electricity is harnessed\nfrom chemical reactions. The difference in fuel cells when compared to\nbatteries is their ability to be powered by the constant flow of\nhydrogen found in the atmosphere. Furthermore, they produce only water\nas a by-product, and are virtually silent. The downside of hydrogen\npowered fuel cells is the high cost and dangers of storing highly\ncombustible hydrogen under pressure.[175]\n\nOne way new processors can overcome the dangers of transporting hydrogen\nis to produce it as necessary. The microreactors can be joined to create\na system that heats the hydrocarbon under high pressure to generate\nhydrogen gas and carbon dioxide, a process called steam reforming. This\nproduces up to 160 gallons of hydrogen/minute and gives the potential of\npowering hydrogen refueling stations, or even an on-board hydrogen fuel\nsource for hydrogen cell vehicles.[176] Implementation into cars would\nallow energy-rich fuels, such as biodiesel, to be transferred to kinetic\nenergy while avoiding combustion and pollutant byproducts. The\nhand-sized square piece of metal contains microscopic channels with\ncatalytic sites, which continuously convert biodiesel, and even its\nglycerol byproduct, to hydrogen.[177]\n\n### Safflower oil\n\n, researchers at Australia's [CSIRO](CSIRO \"wikilink\") have been\nstudying [safflower](safflower \"wikilink\") oil from a specially-bred\nvariety as an engine [lubricant](lubricant \"wikilink\"), and researchers\nat [Montana State University](Montana_State_University \"wikilink\")'s\nAdvanced Fuel Centre in the US have been studying the oil's performance\nin a large [diesel engine](diesel_engine \"wikilink\"), with results\ndescribed as a \"game-changer\".[178]\n\n## Concerns\n\n### Engine wear\n\nLubricity of fuel plays an important role in wear that occurs in an\nengine. A diesel engine relies on its fuel to provide lubricity for the\nmetal components that are constantly in contact with each other.[179]\nBiodiesel is a much better lubricant compared with fossil petroleum\ndiesel due to the presence of esters. Tests have shown that the addition\nof a small amount of biodiesel to diesel can significantly increase the\nlubricity of the fuel in short term.[180] However, over a longer period\nof time (2–4 years), studies show that biodiesel loses its\nlubricity.[181] This could be because of enhanced corrosion over time\ndue to oxidation of the unsaturated molecules or increased water content\nin biodiesel from moisture absorption.[182]\n\n### Fuel viscosity\n\nOne of the main concerns regarding biodiesel is its viscosity. The\nviscosity of diesel is 2.5–3.2 cSt at 40 °C and the viscosity of\nbiodiesel made from soybean oil is between 4.2 and 4.6 cSt[183] The\nviscosity of diesel must be high enough to provide sufficient\nlubrication for the engine parts but low enough to flow at operational\ntemperature. High viscosity can plug the fuel filter and injection\nsystem in engines.[184] Vegetable oil is composed of lipids with long\nchains of hydrocarbons, to reduce its viscosity the lipids are broken\ndown into smaller molecules of esters. This is done by converting\nvegetable oil and animal fats into alkyl esters using\ntransesterification to reduce their viscosity[185] Nevertheless,\nbiodiesel viscosity remains higher than that of diesel, and the engine\nmay not be able to use the fuel at low temperatures due to the slow flow\nthrough the fuel filter.[186]\n\n### Engine performance\n\nBiodiesel has higher brake-specific fuel consumption compared to diesel,\nwhich means more biodiesel fuel consumption is required for the same\ntorque. However, B20 biodiesel blend has been found to provide maximum\nincrease in thermal efficiency, lowest brake-specific energy\nconsumption, and lower harmful emissions.[187][188][189] The engine\nperformance depends on the properties of the fuel, as well as on\ncombustion, injector pressure and many other factors.[190] Since there\nare various blends of biodiesel, that may account for the contradicting\nreports as regards engine performance.\n\n## See also\n\n-   [MY Ady Gil](MY_Ady_Gil \"wikilink\")\n-   [Civic amenity site](Civic_amenity_site \"wikilink\"); collection\n    point for [WVO](Waste_vegetable_oil \"wikilink\")\n-   [EcoJet concept car](EcoJet_concept_car \"wikilink\")\n-   [Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of\n    2008](Food,_Conservation,_and_Energy_Act_of_2008 \"wikilink\")\n-   [Gasoline gallon equivalent](Gasoline_gallon_equivalent \"wikilink\")\n-   [Sustainable biofuel](Sustainable_biofuel \"wikilink\")\n-   [Table of biofuel crop\n    yields](Table_of_biofuel_crop_yields \"wikilink\")\n-   [Tonne of oil equivalent](Tonne_of_oil_equivalent \"wikilink\")\n-   [Vegetable oil economy](Vegetable_oil_economy \"wikilink\")\n-   [Vegetable oil fuel](Vegetable_oil_fuel \"wikilink\")\n-   [Fuel (film)](Fuel_(film) \"wikilink\")\n-   [United States vs. Imperial\n    Petroleum](United_States_vs._Imperial_Petroleum \"wikilink\")\n\n## References\n\n-   *An Overview of Biodiesel and Petroleum Diesel Lifecycles*, May\n    1998, Sheehan, *et al.* NREL [(60pp pdf\n    file)](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24772.pdf)\n\n-   *Business Management for Biodiesel Producers*, January 2004, Jon Von\n    Gerpen, Iowa State University under contract with the National\n    Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [(210pp pdf\n    file)](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36242.pdf)\n\n-   *[Energy balances in the growth of oilseed rape for biodiesel and of\n    wheat for\n    bioethanol](https://web.archive.org/web/20010108231400/http://www.biodiesel.co.uk/levington.htm)*,\n    June 2000, I.R.
